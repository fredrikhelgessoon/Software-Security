# SoftwareSecurity

This repository contains three assignments from the Software Secyurity course on Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola.
If you are attending this course, beware of spoilers.
Note that this repository only contains the solutions created by me and a classmate and not the complete set of files provided  in the assignment.

## Android
This task included an Android APK file with a vulnerable game bundled with a PCAP file showing network communication between the application and a host.

## Overflow
This task contains exploiting a C-program with a buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Source code
The objective of this assignment was to perform a source code analysis on a vulnerable server. The goal of this assignment was to solve 5 tasks:
  1. Research about CVE and CWE
  2. Setup system environment to enable buffer overflow testing
  3. Redirect code flow to uncalled "secret" function
  4. Get hostname of the machine running the server
  5. Get shell on server machine
